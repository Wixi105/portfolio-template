# Have I Been Cowardly?

As I sit here, pen in hand, I find myself grappling with a profound sense of unease. It's a feeling that has been gnawing at me for some time now, a quiet whisper in the back of my mind that has finally grown too loud to ignore. As a Christian, I've always believed in the power of faith, love, and compassion. But today, I must confront an uncomfortable truth: Have I been cowardly in the way I live out my faith?

This question lead me down a path of introspection, forcing me to examine the very foundations of my beliefs and actions. It compelled me to explore the complex relationship between fear, faith, and the call to sacrifice oneself for the greater good.

Christ's teachings are clear. We are called to be bold in our faith, to stand up for what is right, and to love our neighbors as ourselves. Yet, as I look back on my actions – or rather, my inactions – I can't help but feel I've fallen short of this calling. How many times have I witnessed injustice and remained silent? How often have I seen my brothers and sisters suffering under the weight of others' bad decisions and hardship not of their own creation, yet chosen the comfort of inaction over the risk of speaking out?

## What happens when fear paralyzes us?

Fear is a powerful force. It can cloud our judgment, stifle our voices, and keep us rooted in inaction. Kierkegaard explored this concept deeply, describing anxiety as the "dizziness of freedom." He argued that the possibility of choice, and the responsibility that comes with it, can lead to a paralyzing dread. As Christians, we are not immune to this fear. In fact, our faith often puts us in direct conflict with the powers and principalities of this world. The fear of persecution, of social ostracism, or even of physical harm can be overwhelming. But does this fear justify our silence?

In Ghana, where politics often intertwines with every aspect of life, the consequences of political decisions can be devastating for many. Families struggle under the burden of economic policies that seem to favor the few over the many. Communities are torn apart by divisive rhetoric and unfulfilled promises. As a Christian, shouldn't I be at the forefront of calling for justice and equality? Shouldn't my voice be among the loudest, demanding accountability from those in power and advocating for the marginalized?

Micah's words ring in my ears: "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8). This call to justice is not passive; it requires action, engagement, and often, confrontation with those who wield power unjustly.

Christ's love was not passive either. It was not a mere feeling, but an active force that drove Him to challenge the status quo, to stand up to injustice, and ultimately, to lay down His life for all of humanity. "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends" (John 15:13). These words echo in my mind, a stark reminder of the depth of love we are called to embody.

But have I truly lived up to this standard? Have I been willing to sacrifice my comfort, my safety, or my reputation for the sake of my brothers and sisters?

The concept of self-sacrifice for the greater good is not unique to Christianity. The Greeks had a concept of "philotimo" which encompasses a range of virtues, including honor, duty, and self-sacrifice for the common good. Similarly, Cicero spoke of "summum bonum" – the highest good – which often requires putting the needs of society above one's own. As Christians, we are called to an even higher standard of self-sacrifice. Christ Himself set the ultimate example, willingly going to the cross for the salvation of humanity. How then can we justify prioritizing our own comfort and safety over the wellbeing of others?

Yet, there is an apparent tension in Scripture. On one hand, we are called to "mind our own business" and "lead a quiet life" (1 Thessalonians 4:11). On the other, we are exhorted to "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy" (Proverbs 31:8-9). How do we reconcile these seemingly contradictory instructions? Is there a middle ground between minding our own business and standing up against injustice?

Reinhold Niebuhr argued that while personal ethics might call for non-violence and turning the other cheek, social ethics often require confrontation with evil and the use of power to establish justice. Perhaps the key lies in discernment. We are called to be "wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16). This suggests a need for strategic engagement with the world, guided by wisdom and motivated by love.

My silence and inaction come at a cost – not just to me, but to those around me. Every time I choose not to speak up against some injustice, every instance where I fail to stand alongside those who are suffering, I am not just falling short of my Christian duty. I am actively contributing to the perpetuation of injustice. "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." What will I say when I stand before God? How will I account for my silence in the face of oppression and injustice?

As Christians, we are called to be more than just "good men." We are called to be salt and light in the world, to be agents of God's love and justice. When I stand before God, will He ask me why I didn't speak out against tyrants and wicked people? Will He question why I chose comfort over confrontation, safety over sacrifice? The prophet Ezekiel warns us of the consequences of failing to warn the wicked to turn from their ways (Ezekiel 33:8-9). Have I been a faithful watchman, or have I neglected my duty?

As these thoughts swirl in my mind, a harsh realization dawns. Acknowledgment of my failings is but a hollow gesture if not followed by genuine change. Yet, how many times have I recognized my shortcomings only to retreat into the comfort of inaction? The path of true repentance is steep and treacherous, demanding not just a change of heart, but a fundamental transformation of my very being.
The call to engage with the injustices plaguing my community and country rings in my ears, but do I answer it? Or do I silence it with excuses of busyness, of not being qualified enough, of fearing the consequences? How often have I chosen to remain silent in the face of wrongdoing, justifying my inaction with platitudes about picking my battles or avoiding conflict?

The words of Christ echo accusingly: "Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me" (Matthew 25:40). But what have I truly done? Have I used my voice to speak out against injustice, or have I muzzled myself out of fear of repercussions? Have I actively participated in initiatives seeking positive change, or have I contented myself with passive approval from the sidelines?
The early Christian church was a beacon of community and mutual support, its members willingly facing persecution for their faith and their stand against societal evils. Yet, here I stand, isolated in my comfort, shying away from even the slightest possibility of discomfort or social awkwardness. Have I used the concept of individual prayer as a shield to avoid the messy, demanding work of communal action?

As I read articles to prepare to write this, I stumbled upon Dietrich Bonhoeffer's words, "Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act." In the face of such a stark truth, how can I justify my silence? My inaction? The realization is painful – each moment of silence, each instance of inaction, has been a conscious choice to side with oppression, to enable injustice.

As I contemplate standing before God, the weight of these choices bears down upon me. What defense can I offer for prioritizing my comfort over the wellbeing of my brothers and sisters? How can I explain choosing self-preservation over the self-sacrificial love that Christ exemplified?

The tension between personal peace and social responsibility, between fear and courage, between self-preservation and self-sacrifice, is not a puzzle to be solved, but a daily crucible in which my faith is tested and often found wanting. Each day presents opportunities to stand for justice, to be the voice for the voiceless, to love in action and not just in word. And each day, more often than not, I fail to rise to the occasion.

Augustine of Hippo spoke of hope's two daughters: Anger and Courage. But what happens when anger at injustice is smothered by complacency, when courage is suffocated by fear? What remains is not hope, but a pale, ineffectual shadow of faith.

As I conclude this reflection, I find no comfort, no easy resolutions. Instead, I am left with piercing questions that demand answers: Have I been a coward in my faith? Have I betrayed the call of Christ through my silence and inaction? And if so, do I have the courage to change, truly change, no matter the cost? Or will I continue in comfortable cowardice, turning a blind eye to the suffering around me?
The answer to these questions lies not in words, but in the actions I choose to take from this moment forward. The world watches, the oppressed cry out, and God sees all. What will I do?
